//TODO: Go through class activitites and pull out steps one by one://

//*Dependencies, initialize express, routes, db, npm, ports, listening for ports.//

//? HOW DO YOU GET IT TO KILL THE TERMINAL? AND THEN RERUN? AND THEN OPEN IN THE BROWSER?? DOES THE ERROR THAT POPS UP IN BROWSER HAVE TO DO WITH ME DELETING THE CACHE FROM THE NODE MODULES WHEN I HAD A DUPLICATE? DO I NEED TO INSTALL NPM?

//*Where did I leave off? 2/12/23
//*cleaned up folders, took out duplicate .gits. Doesn't seem like I added a lot, but it should now start working in the future. Decided not to use nodemon as it kept crashing. Not sure if that is because of the duplication (probably), but for now, I just want to keep it easy.//

//* Follow TODO for next step.
